# MyTrello

Lightweight Kanban-style To Do app built with React + TypeScript. Organize tasks in draggable columns, add tags and due dates, toggle dark mode, and track progress with a built-in chart. Works offline with local persistence, import/export, optimistic updates, and undo/redo.

## Run Locally

Prerequisites: Node.js (>=16) and npm

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This repository contains the frontend source for the MyTrello app. Open the app in your browser at the URL printed by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

If you want to connect to a backend API, update `API_BASE_URL` in `constants.ts`.
